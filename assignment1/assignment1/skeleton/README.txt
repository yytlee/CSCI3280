The program get the patch images in the folder named "patch". The three patch images should named as (from the deepest to the lightest colour) 0.bmp, 1.bmp, 2.bmp.
Quantization is simply did by divide the grayscale values into three groups equally with the same intervel.
The program can handle rectangle input image and resize to given number (or smaller). It will get and transform the image data to patch image directly without saving extra information.
